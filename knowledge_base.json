      "question": "What is a DNA?",
      "answer": " DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning, and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. It's a double-helix structure composed of nucleotides, each containing a phosphate group, a sugar group, and a nitrogen base."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells?",
      "answer": "Prokaryotic cells are single-celled organisms without a nucleus or other membrane-bound organelles. Eukaryotic cells are found in plants and animals and have a nucleus and organelles, making them more complex."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do plants perform photosynthesis?",
      "answer": "Plants use sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water to produce glucose and oxygen in a process known as photosynthesis. This occurs in the chloroplasts, using chlorophyll to capture sunlight."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is natural selection?",
      "answer": " Natural selection is the process by which organisms better adapted to their environment tend to survive and produce more offspring. This is a key mechanism of evolution."
    },
    {
      "question": " What is an ecosystem?",
      "answer": "An ecosystem is a community of living organisms in conjunction with the nonliving components of their environment, interacting\u00a0as\u00a0a\u00a0system."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is biodiversity important?",
      "answer": "Biodiversity boosts ecosystem productivity and resilience, allowing it to withstand challenges and provide services such as air and water purification, pest management, and pollination."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do vaccines work?",
      "answer": "Vaccines stimulate the body's immune system to recognize and fight pathogens without causing the disease, providing future immunity."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are stem cells?",
      "answer": "Stem cells are undifferentiated cells capable of giving rise to indefinitely more cells of the same type and from which certain other kinds of cell arise by differentiation."

    {
      "question": "What is genetic mutation?",
      "answer": "A genetic mutation is a change in the nucleotide sequence of the genetic material of an organism."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do antibiotics work?",
      "answer": "Antibiotics work by killing or inhibiting the growth of bacteria, targeting bacterial processes or structures."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is osmosis?",
      "answer": "Osmosis is the movement of water across a semipermeable membrane from an area of low solute concentration to an area of high solute concentration."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a gene?",
      "answer": "A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the information to produce a functional product, typically a protein."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are enzymes?",
      "answer": "Enzymes are proteins that act as biological catalysts, speeding up chemical reactions in cells."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a habitat?",
      "answer": " A habitat is the natural environment in which a species lives and grows."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a food chain?",
      "answer": "A food chain describes the feeding relationships between species within an ecosystem, showing how energy and nutrients flow from one organism to another."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is an adaptation?",
      "answer": "An adaptation is a trait that increases an organism's chance of survival and reproduction in a specific environment."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a chromosome?",
      "answer": "A chromosome is a long DNA molecule with part or all of the genetic material of an organism."
